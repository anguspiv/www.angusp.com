title: Hi, I'm Angus!
---

I'm a Software Engineer and Manager based in Los Angeles, CA. I specialize in
Full Stack Web App Development taking extra care to provide the best
solution to his customers problems, whether they are internal or external.

As a Manager, I focus on building and maintaining teams of talented engineers
that are passionate about growth, learning and self-reliance. I strive to create
a culture of collaboration and trust.

Feel free to check out my [resume](/resume), read some of my [posts](/posts),
or learn more about me below.

My years of experience in the industry has seen me work on several different
recognizeable properties and projects, including
[South Park Studios](https://www.southparkstudios.com/),
[Toyota](https://www.toyota.com/), and
[The Walt Disney Company](https://dmedmedia.disney.com/). I've also spent time
in the trenches of smaller startups such as [DogVacay](https://www.dogvacay.com/)
and Rex Homes. I've been both an individual contributor on large teams, and a
leader building and managing my own team.

When I'm not coding the day away, I'm advocate for sharing my experience and
knowledge, to pay forward all those that helped me in my career growth.
Working with [JS.LA](https://js.la/), I help organize
[community events](https://lunch.js.la/), and
[mentor](https://community.juniortosenior.io/) and coach my peers whenever
he gets the chance.

When I finally put the laptop away, you can find me strumming
away on one of my many guitars that, I've has been told on many times, take up
way too much space in his home. That our trying to teach myself drums too!

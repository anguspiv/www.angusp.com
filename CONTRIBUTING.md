# Contributing to www.angusp.com

First off, thanks for taking the time to contribute! ❤️ Second, this is mostly a
generated template, which I guess is not neccesary for a personal website. But
hey, it's here now. 🤷‍♂️ Also I like to share how I work and what I value, so
others can learn from it, so here we go. 🚀

All types of contributions are encouraged and valued. See the
[Table of Contents](#table-of-contents) for different ways to help and details
about how this project handles them. Please make sure to read the relevant
section before making your contribution. It will make it a lot easier for us
maintainers and smooth out the experience for all involved. The community looks
forward to your contributions. 🎉

Honestly, considering this repo is just my personal website, I'm not sure why or
how you'd want to contribute. But if you do, I'm grateful for your interest and
support. 🙏
Heck, if you just wanna chat about the project or anything else, feel free to
start up a [Discussion](https://github.com/anguspiv/www.angusp.com/discussions).

> And if you like the project, but just don't have time to contribute, that's
> fine. There are other easy ways to support the project and show your
> appreciation, which we would also be very happy about:

> - Star the project
> - Tweet about it
> - Refer this project in your project's readme
> - Mention the project at local meetups and tell your friends/colleagues

Totally not using this as an oppurtunity to self-promote. :sweat_smile:

## Code of Conduct

This project and everyone participating in it is governed by the
[www.angusp.com Code of Conduct](https://github.com/anguspiv/www.angusp.com/blob//CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).
By participating, you are expected to uphold this code. Please report
unacceptable behavior to <angusp@angusp.com>.

## I Have a Question

> If you want to ask a question, we assume that you have read the available
> [Documentation](https://anguspiv.github.io/www.angusp.com/).

Before you ask a question, it is best to search for existing
[Issues](https://github.com/anguspiv/www.angusp.com/issues) or
[Discussions](https://github.com/anguspiv/www.angusp.com/discussions) that might
help you. In case you have found a suitable issue and still need clarification,
you can write your question in this issue. It is also advisable to search the
internet for answers first.

If you then still feel the need to ask a question and need clarification, we
recommend the following:

- Open an [Discussion](https://github.com/anguspiv/www.angusp.com/discussions/new?category=q-a)
  in the [Q&A](https://github.com/anguspiv/www.angusp.com/discussions/categories/q-a)
  topic.
- Provide as much context as you can about what you're running into.
- Provide project and platform versions (nodejs, npm, etc), depending on what
  seems relevant.

We will then take care of the issue as soon as possible.

### Reporting Bugs

<!-- omit in toc -->

#### Before Submitting a Bug Report

A good bug report shouldn't leave others needing to chase you up for more
information. Therefore, we ask you to investigate carefully, collect information
and describe the issue in detail in your report. Please complete the following
steps in advance to help us fix any potential bug as fast as possible.

- Make sure that you are using the latest version.
- Determine if your bug is really a bug and not an error on your side e.g. using
  incompatible environment components/versions (Make sure that you have read the
  [documentation](https://anguspiv.github.io/www.angusp.com/). If you are
  looking for support, you might want to check
  [this section](#i-have-a-question)).
- To see if other users have experienced (and potentially already solved) the
  same issue you are having, check if there is not already a bug report existing
  for your bug or error in the
  [bug tracker](https://github.com/anguspiv/www.angusp.com/issues?q=label%3Abug).
- Also make sure to search the internet (including Stack Overflow) to see if
  users outside of the GitHub community have discussed the issue.
- Collect information about the bug:
  - Stack trace (Traceback)
  - OS, Platform and Version (Windows, Linux, macOS, x86, ARM)
  - Version of the interpreter, compiler, SDK, runtime environment,
    package manager, depending on what seems relevant.
  - Possibly your input and the output
  - Can you reliably reproduce the issue? And can you also reproduce it with
    older versions?

<!-- omit in toc -->

#### How Do I Submit a Good Bug Report?

> You must never report security related issues, vulnerabilities or bugs
> including sensitive information to the issue tracker, or elsewhere in public.
> Instead sensitive bugs must be sent by email to <angusp@angusp.com>.

<!-- You may add a PGP key to allow the messages to be sent encrypted as well. -->

We use GitHub issues to track bugs and errors. If you run into an issue with the
project:

- Open an [Issue](https://github.com/anguspiv/www.angusp.com/issues/new).
  (Since we can't be sure at this point whether it is a bug or not, we ask you
  not to talk about a bug yet and not to label the issue.)
- Explain the behavior you would expect and the actual behavior.
- Please provide as much context as possible and describe the
  _reproduction steps_ that someone else can follow to recreate the issue on
  their own. This usually includes your code. For good bug reports you should
  isolate the problem and create a reduced test case.
- Provide the information you collected in the previous section.

Once it's filed:

- The project team will label the issue accordingly.
- A team member will try to reproduce the issue with your provided steps. If
  there are no reproduction steps or no obvious way to reproduce the issue,
  the team will ask you for those steps and mark the issue as `needs-repro`.
  Bugs with the `needs-repro` tag will not be addressed until they are
  reproduced.
- If the team is able to reproduce the issue, it will be marked `needs-fix`, as
  well as possibly other tags (such as `critical`), and the issue will be left
  to be [implemented by someone](#your-first-code-contribution).

### Suggesting Enhancements

This section guides you through submitting an enhancement suggestion for
www.angusp.com, **including completely new features and minor improvements to
existing functionality**. Following these guidelines will help maintainers and
the community to understand your suggestion and find related suggestions.

<!-- omit in toc -->

#### Before Submitting an Enhancement

- Make sure that you are using the latest version.
- Read the [documentation](https://anguspiv.github.io/www.angusp.com/) carefully
  and find out if the functionality is already covered, maybe by an individual
  configuration.
- Perform a [search](https://github.com/anguspiv/www.angusp.com/issues) to see
  if the enhancement has already been suggested. If it has, add a comment to the
  existing issue instead of opening a new one.
- Find out whether your idea fits with the scope and aims of the project. It's
  up to you to make a strong case to convince the project's developers of the
  merits of this feature. Keep in mind that we want features that will be useful
  to the majority of our users and not just a small subset. If you're just
  targeting a minority of users, consider writing an add-on/plugin library.

<!-- omit in toc -->

#### How Do I Submit a Good Enhancement Suggestion?

Enhancement suggestions are tracked as
[GitHub issues](https://github.com/anguspiv/www.angusp.com/issues).

- Use a **clear and descriptive title** for the issue to identify the
  suggestion.
- Provide a **step-by-step description of the suggested enhancement** in as many
  details as possible.
- **Describe the current behavior** and **explain which behavior you expected to
  see instead** and why. At this point you can also tell which alternatives do
  not work for you.
- You may want to **include screenshots or screen recordings** which help you
  demonstrate the steps or point out the part which the suggestion is related
  to. You can use [LICEcap](https://www.cockos.com/licecap/) to record GIFs on
  macOS and Windows, and the built-in
  [screen recorder in GNOME](https://help.gnome.org/users/gnome-help/stable/screen-shot-record.html.en)
  or [SimpleScreenRecorder](https://github.com/MaartenBaert/ssr) on Linux.
  <!-- this should only be included if the project has a GUI -->
- **Explain why this enhancement would be useful** to most www.angusp.com users.
  You may also want to point out the other projects that solved it better and
  which could serve as inspiration.

  your forked repo to your local machine

<!-- omit in toc -->

#### Local Development

To set up your deve
lopment environment, you will need to:

<!-- omit in toc -->

##### 1. Fork the www.angusp.com repo

Fork the www.angusp.com repo by clicking on the fork button on the top of the
page. This will create a copy of this repository in your account.

<!-- omit in toc -->

##### 2. Checkout the repository to your local machine

```bash
git clone {{ your forked repo url }}
```

<!-- omit in toc -->

##### 3. Install the dependencies

This project uses [`npm`](https://docs.npmjs.com/) to manage dependencies. Run
the following command to install the dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

If you are unfamiliar with `npm`, please take a few minutes to familiarize
yourself with it. It is a powerful tool that you will need to use to contribute
to this project. Learn more about `npm` by reading the [npm documentation](https://docs.npmjs.com/).

<!-- omit in toc -->

##### 4a. Start the development server

Once you have installed the dependencies, you can run the project locally using:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This will start an [astro](https://astro.build/) development server at
[`http://localhost:4321`](). You can now make changes to the project and see the
results in real-time. The server will automatically reload when you make changes
to the project.

<!-- omit in toc -->

##### 4b. Run the tests

This project uses [`vitest`](https://vitest.dev/) and
[`@testing-library`](https://testing-library.com/) for testing. You can run the
tests using:

```bash
npm test
```

This will run the tests in watch mode and output the results in the terminal.
You can also generate a coverage report using:

```bash
npm run test:coverage
```

<!-- omit in toc -->

##### 4c. Run the linter

This project uses [`eslint`](https://eslint.org/) and
[`prettier`](https://prettier.io/) for linting. You can run the linter using:

```bash
npm run lint
```

This will run the linter and output any errors or warnings in the terminal. You
can also fix any auto-fixable issues using:

```bash
npm run lint:fix
```

<!-- omit in toc -->

##### 4d. Run Storybook

This project uses [`storybook`](https://storybook.js.org/) for component
development and documentation. You can run Storybook using:

```bash
npm run storybook
```

This will start a Storybook server at [`http://localhost:6006`](). You can now
view the components in Storybook and make changes to them in real-time. The
server will automatically reload when you make changes to the components.

<!-- omit in toc -->

##### 5. Create a new branch

This project uses the `main` branch as the default branch. All development work
should be done on a separate branch. Additionally we use
[trunk-based development](https://trunkbaseddevelopment.com/) and feature
branches. Meaning that we do not use long-lived branches like `develop` or
`release`.

We recommend naming your branch using the following convention:

- `feature/<issue-number>-your-feature-name` for new features
- `bugfix/<issue-number>-your-bugfix-name` for bug fixes
- `chore/<issue-number>-your-chore-name` for chores

For example, if you are working on a new feature to add a dark mode to the
project and the issue number is `#123`, you would name your branch
`feature/123-dark-mode`. You can create a new branch using:

```bash
git switch -c feature/123-dark-mode
```

<!-- omit in toc -->

##### 6. Make your changes

Now that you have set up your development environment, you can start making
changes to the project. You can use your favorite code editor to make changes to
the project files. You can also use the development server to see the changes in
real-time.

<!-- omit in toc -->

##### 7. Commit your changes

We use [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) for commit
messages. This helps us automatically generate changelogs and version numbers.
If you are unfamiliar with Conventional Commits, please take a few minutes to
familiarize yourself with them. You can commit your changes using:

```bash
git commit -m "feat: add dark mode"
```

<!-- omit in toc -->

##### 8. Push your changes

Once you have committed your changes, you can push them to your forked
repository using:

```bash
git push origin feature/123-dark-mode
```

<!-- omit in toc -->

##### 9. Create a pull request

Once you have pushed your changes to your forked repository, you can create a
pull request to by clicking on the "New pull request" button on the main
repository page. Make sure to provide a detailed description of your changes and
reference the issue number in the pull request description.

We recommend naming your pull request using the following convention:

- `Feature: Add dark mode` for new features
- `Bugfix: Fix dark mode` for bug fixes
- `Chore: Update dependencies` for chores

For example, if you are working on a new feature to add a dark mode to the
project and the issue number is `#123`, you would name your pull request
`Feature: Add dark mode (#123)`.
You can create a pull request using:

```bash
gh pr create --base main --head feature/123-dark-mode
```

<!-- omit in toc -->

##### 10. Review and merge

Once you have created a pull request, a project maintainer will review your
changes and provide feedback. If everything looks good, your changes will be
merged into the main branch and will be included in the next release.

With much appreciation, you have successfully contributed to the project. 🎉

### Improving The Documentation

Our [Documentation](https://anguspiv.github.io/www.angusp.com/) is important. It helps users understand how to use the project and
how to contribute to it. If you find an error in the documentation or if you
think something is missing, you can help improve it by following these steps:

- Open an [Bug Issue](https://github.com/anguspiv/www.angusp.com/issues/new)
  and describe the issue you found or the improvement you would like to make.
- If you are able to fix the issue or make the improvement yourself, you can
  create a pull request with the changes. Make sure to reference the issue number
  in the pull request description.
- If you are not able to fix the issue or make the improvement yourself, you can
  still open an issue and describe the issue or improvement. A project maintainer
  will review the issue and make the necessary changes.

## Styleguides

### Commit Messages

This project uses [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/)
for commit messages. This helps us automatically generate changelogs and version
numbers. If you are unfamiliar with Conventional Commits, please take a few
minutes to familiarize yourself with them.

A conventional commit message should have the following format:

``
<type>[optional scope]: <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer]

```

The `type` should be one of the following:

- `feat`: A new feature
- `fix`: A bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation changes
- `style`: Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code (white-space,
  formatting, missing semi-colons, etc)
- `refactor`: A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
- `perf`: A code change that improves performance
- `test`: Adding missing tests or correcting existing tests
- `chore`: Changes to the build process or auxiliary tools and libraries such as
  documentation generation

The `scope` is optional and should be the name of the module or component that
the commit affects.

The `description` should be a short, imperative tense description of the change.

The `body` is optional and should provide a more detailed description of the

The `footer` is optional and should contain any breaking changes, issues closed
by the commit, or other information that is relevant to the commit.

Here are some examples of conventional commit messages:

```

feat: add dark mode

This commit adds a dark mode to the project

BREAKING CHANGE: The light mode has been removed

Closes #123

```

```

fix: fix dark mode

This commit fixes a bug in the dark mode

Closes #123

```

```

docs: update README
